# Arch installer, fluxbox edition
auto script to install my arch with fluxbox window manager, and load all the settings for me, so i dont have to do them every single time

To do
=====
write the script for aur_pamac_install.sh

add pamac-manager to gnome-pie -> aur_pamac_install.sh

add pamac to pacman ignored list -> aur_pamac_install.sh

#DONE# There is a refference to ec user in fluxbox startup script. fix it.
#DONE, TEST IT OUT# Add --dpi 90 to xrandr on the startup

#NOT NEEDED ANYMORE# Add startup script to run persepolis, sleep for 1 second and then kill it

Add discord to the installer and gnome-pie. #added to the installer

xterm keeps opening with pink color. fix that one as well.

#DONE# also see if you can add the pre arch-chroot commands to it as well. we need two installer scripts. one for pre arch-chroot and one for post

add conky and my own conky setup to the build
